fLoop
=====

fLoop is an cross platform audio file navigation tool that provides a simple interface to navigate a large number of loops by tempo, rhythmic and timbral distances. It is a GPL licensed standalone application, built on the JUCE framework in C++. It also uses the Eigen library, and the dRowAudio module for JUCE.

Build Instructions
==================

-> Open up the .jucer file with the Introjucer, assuming you have the JUCE.
-> Check the paths to the modules, in the config tab.
-> Save and open in your editor of choice!
